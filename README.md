Flutter currently lacks a dedicated, functional, and accurate AR/VR plugin. To address this gap, BreakthroughF1 LLP has introduced a powerful AR/VR plugin for Flutter, enabling seamless integration of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) functionalities.

## Features

- **Augmented Reality (AR) Support**: Easily add AR elements to your Flutter applications.
- **Virtual Reality (VR) Capabilities**: Develop immersive VR experiences with minimal effort.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Fully supports Android, Windows, Mac, and iOS.
- **Optimized Performance**: Ensures efficient rendering and smooth interactions.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple setup with minimal configuration.
- **Customizable**: Offers flexible options to suit different use cases.

## Installation

To install the Flutter AR/VR plugin, follow these steps:

### 1. Add Dependency

Add the plugin to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:

Then, run the following command to fetch the package:

```bash

```

### 2. Import the Plugin

Import the plugin in your Dart code:
